    <h2>
        Multi-Classifier for Renaissance Paintings Using a CNN 
    </h2>

    <p>
        Image recognition is a popular topic in machine learning and frequently appears in everyday life, unbeknownst to the untrained eye.  
        We see it in law-enforcement cameras, self-driving cars, phones, and more.  Consequently, ethical issues have risen where people’s privacy comes into question.  
        Regardless, image recognition can be applied into many unique areas. 
    </p>

        <div class="aligncenter">
          <img src="/Projects and Papers/Classifying Paintings with CNN/imagerecog.jpg", alt="Imagerec" style="width:100%">
        </div>

    <p>
        Inspired from PBS shows where historians validate the legitimacy of paintings or artwork, could someone (me), 
        spot foregies and real paintings with the help of image recognition?  Historians often use the style of brush strokes, 
        chemical composition of paints, signatures, and carbon dating to validate pieces of art.  
        Theoretically, with the highest resolution attainable, 
        a computer can see the brush strokes and use that as a form of classification whether a painting belongs to a certain artist or not.  
        This is the first of many issues with this project: space.  
        I doubt my computer can house a training dataset of reasonable size, where the resolution allows for close ups of brush strokes.  
        Another issue I ran into, is that Google recently changed something that does not allow the Python scripts I have for mass image downloading.  
        These issues are definitely fixable, but probably something I’ll need help with in obtaining high resolution images of verified art.
    </p>

    <p>
        After dealing with these issues I decided on a variation of the original idea, 
        where I classify the style of paintings. 
        By style I am referring to a painting’s origin.  
        For example, ancient Italian, Japanese, Spanish, German, paintings all possess different styles.  
        Therefore, the planned project is for someone to input an unfamiliar painting and have the model output its origin.  
        I predict that the model would work well with very few classes, the classes are the country of origin.  
        The model might distinguish between Japanese and Italian art well, but maybe not Japanese and Chinese.  
        The persistent issue is obtaining the data without a mass downloader or collections of art I can download with one click, 
        so I am gonna have to deal with a fairly small set of images. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The first attempt is to see if a model can distinguish between two forms of art, 
        Japanese and Italian.  
        If a model performs terrible here, then a model with more classes is probably gonna be even worse.  
        For reference, there are images below for the Japanese and Italian art style based off of Google’s image search.
    </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="img_snow.jpg" alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="img_forest.jpg" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Some basic observations are that the Japanese paintings have plain backgrounds 
        while the entirety of the Italian paintings are completely filled and painted.  
        Once the images are given labels and are separated into training and testing sets, 
        I can construct the convolutional neural network (CNN).  
        Unlike other neural networks, the CNN is a little bit more specific in terms of its architecture.  
        The first layer will do feature mapping while the last layer typically uses softmax function for multiclass classification.  
        In my first data set where I am attempting to classify Japanese and Italian art, a logistic function might be better since I have binary classes.
        Since the CNN needs a convolutional layer to begin with, I am using the Conv2D layer from the keras packaged where I have the Maxsoftpooling2D layer between another convolution later.  
        The pooling layer is tasked with reducing the size of the images while preserving their important characteristics.  
        Along with additional layers and ReLu functions, the CNN is on my github (insert link) where you can take a closer look.
    </p>

    <p>
        After running the model, with only 35 training and 15 testing, 
        I received an accuracy of about 73%.  
        It’s not exactly great, but it’s a start.  
        The accuracy plots are below: it appears that...INSERT OBSERVATIONS.
    </p>

    <p>
        I did eventually find a way to mass download images off of Google, but it still comes with its challenges.  
        Since I am downloading the paintings off of Google Images, 
        I have to trust that Google gives me legitimate paintings when I search something like, 
        “French Renaissance Paintings.”  And in conclusion, Google is a liar.  
        The downloading worked better than dragging and dropping images by hand, but when I was checking my folders, 
        there’s pictures of Anthony Hopkins and other peculiar outliers that I had to delete.  
        Other downloads that would threaten training included actual photographs or images with text boxes over them.
    </p>

    <p>
        So now, for the new model I have an increased data set for each country of origin, which means a larger training set.  
        However, I added two additional classes with a total of four: Japanese, Italian, German, and French.  
        German art looks pretty different from Italian and Japanese, but French art looks like a combination of the German and Italian art which poses difficulties.  
        At this point, my model is looking rough.
